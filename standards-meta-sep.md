# Meta SEP by Terminal Labs

# Summary
[summary]: #summary
This SEP is to outline the scope of future SEP's with *specific* standards to impose on the salt repository. These standards are to be argued over by the open source community and the Saltstack developers. Upon reaching a consensus these new standards will be considered endorsed and will be followed henceforth. The Standards can be both hardline rules to be followed without exception and "best practice" recommendations.

Those standards that fall under the "recommendations" category will also include alternative possibilities opposed to the recommendation. This will help illistrate that there is a consensus preference to go about a task, but these other options are not taboos.


# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation
Currently, There are few standards for "best practice" that salt imposes. This is a good thing since it doesn't restrict a user's/team's workflow in their project, or restrict their efforts to contribute new code to the salt repository that solves an edge case or extends salt's functionality.

However, without some standards the repository code has little commonality to outright contradictions from one module to another,  tutorials oppose one anothers approach to solving an issue, and beginners have to jump into the deep end and often decide the standards to follow by themselves.


# Design
[design]: #detailed-design
Standards SEP's will include many concepts found in PEP/SEPs including the following sections:
- Standard
- motivation
- related salt issues/PR/documention
  - This includes supporting, conflicting, missing, convoluted material
- example illistrations & code
  - before and after if possible
- discussion
  - these should be points for contention or clarification

## Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives
- alternative SEP's
  - these should be seperately published SEP's on the same topic.

## Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks
This should includes repository refactoring, documentation changes, and limitations to salt introduced, limitations to the user introduced.
